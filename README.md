## Feature Breakdown

1. **API Documentation**

The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard, ensuring clear specifications for developers and making integration with frontend or third-party services easy.
By leveraging Django REST Framework, the system provides a robust RESTful interface for handling CRUD operations, while GraphQL adds a flexible querying option for clients that need precise data fetching.

2. **User Authentication**

Authentication endpoints like `/users/` and `/users/{user_id}/` allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
This feature ensures that only authorized users can list properties, make bookings, or leave reviews, forming the foundation for user trust and system security.

3. **Property Management**

Endpoints such as `/properties/` and `/properties/{property_id}/` let hosts create, update, view, and delete property listings.
This module enables the core functionality of the Airbnb clone — allowing users to showcase their properties and guests to browse available stays.

4. **Booking System**

Through endpoints like `/bookings/` and `/bookings/{booking_id}/`, guests can book properties, modify bookings, and manage their check-in and check-out details.
This feature ties users and properties together, enabling the platform's primary interaction: reserving a stay.

5. **Payment Processing**

The `/payments/` endpoint handles payment transactions related to bookings, ensuring that hosts get paid and guests' reservations are confirmed.
Secure payment flows build user confidence and automate financial operations critical to the platform's success.

6. **Review System**

Endpoints like `/reviews/` and `/reviews/{review_id}/` allow guests to post feedback about properties after their stay.
The review system promotes transparency, builds host reputations, and helps future guests make informed decisions.

7. **Database Optimizations**

Indexing is implemented on frequently queried fields to speed up data retrieval, while caching is used to reduce load and improve response times.
These optimizations ensure the platform remains fast and scalable, even as the user base and property listings grow.

## API Security

Security isn’t just an add-on — it’s a core requirement to protect user data, financial transactions, platform reliability, and brand reputation. Without strong security practices, the platform would quickly become vulnerable to fraud, data breaches, and legal liabilities. The following security measures will be implemented in this application.

1. **Authentication**

Authentication protects user accounts from unauthorized access. Strong authentication ensures that only legitimate users can log in and interact with the platform, protecting sensitive personal information like addresses and booking history.

Implementation:
- Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt or Django’s built-in PBKDF2) for storing passwords.
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication for secure login and token validation.
- Enable email verification during signup to prevent fake accounts.

2. **Authorization**

Authorization ensures users can only perform actions they are allowed to, preventing misuse (like guests deleting properties or hosts modifying other users’ bookings) and protecting the integrity of user-generated content.

Implementation:
- Role-based access control (RBAC): Different permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.
- API endpoints will enforce checks (e.g., only hosts can create or modify properties, only guests can book properties).
- Fine-grained permissions using Django’s permissions framework or custom middleware.

3. **Rate Limiting**

Rate limiting protects the platform against DDoS attacks, brute force login attempts, and abusive behaviors. It ensures that system resources are fairly available to all users without performance degradation.

Implementation:
- Apply rate limits to API endpoints (e.g., using Django REST Framework's throttling classes or external services like AWS API Gateway throttling).
- Differentiate limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated users.

4. **Data Validation and Sanitization**

Without validation, malicious users could inject harmful scripts or corrupt database records. Proper sanitization ensures the system processes only safe, intended inputs, maintaining data integrity and user safety.

Implementation:
- Validate all user inputs on the backend to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and similar attacks.
- Use serializers in Django REST Framework for strict data validation.

5. **Secure Payment Handling**

Payment handling involves highly sensitive financial data. Securing payment flows protects users from fraud, ensures PCI-DSS compliance, and maintains trust in the platform.

Implementation:
- Integrate with trusted payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
- Never store raw credit card information in the database.
- Use HTTPS encryption for all payment transactions.

6. **HTTPS Everywhere**

HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and server, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that could steal session cookies, login credentials, or payment information.

Implementation:
- Enforce HTTPS using SSL certificates (even in development via self-signed certs if needed).
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.


7. **Logging and Monitoring**

Monitoring helps detect potential breaches early. Quick response to suspicious activities minimizes damage and keeps user trust intact.

Implementation:
- Log suspicious activities like multiple failed login attempts, unexpected API usage patterns, and booking/payment anomalies.
- Integrate alerts for critical security events.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring that new updates are integrated smoothly and reliably into the project without breaking existing functionality.

### Why They Are Important for This Project:

CI/CD pipelines are critical for maintaining a fast, reliable, and professional development workflow. They automatically catch bugs early through testing, enforce code quality standards, and allow for safe and frequent updates to the Airbnb clone. This ensures that features like property listings, bookings, and payments remain stable as the platform grows and evolves.

### Tools for CI/CD

- GitHub Actions: Automates workflows like testing code on each pull request and deploying to production environments.
- Docker: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.
- Docker Compose: Manages multi-container setups, like running Django with a PostgreSQL database during tests.
- AWS/GCP/Heroku (or similar): For hosting and automated deployments after passing tests.
- PostgreSQL: As a production-grade database, often spun up in Docker for integration testing.
